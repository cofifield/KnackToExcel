# Knack To Excel

Knack To Excel is a Visual Basic script written to import data directly from Knack's API into Excel. This allows you to avoid mapping "nice names" to Knack API's internal field naming convention (field_1 instead of a nice name like user_id.)

## Setup

1. Create a macro-enabled Excel workbook
2. Open the Visual Basic editor (alt + f11)
3. Edit the "ThisWorkbook" Excel object
4. Specify username and password for Knack login
5. Update file URL by choosing "Export" on Knack's object export webpage
